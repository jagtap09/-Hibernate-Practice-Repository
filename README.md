# Hibernate Practice Repository

## Description
This repository is a dedicated space for practicing and mastering Hibernate, a widely-used Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework in Java. It includes practical examples and exercises for:

- **Creating tables:** Use Hibernate entity classes and annotations to define and create database tables.
- **Inserting data:** Perform data insertion operations into the database.
- **CRUD operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for database interactions.

By following this repository, we will gain hands-on experience with Hibernate's core functionalities, database configuration, and effective ORM usage.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### 1. `src/main/java`
This folder contains all the Java source code.

#### Subfolders:
- `entity`: Contains the Hibernate entity classes representing the database tables.
- `dao`: Contains Data Access Objects (DAOs) for performing CRUD operations on the database.
- `util`: Contains utility classes like `HibernateUtil` for configuring and managing Hibernate sessions.

### 2. `src/main/resources`
This folder contains configuration files.

#### Files:
- `hibernate.cfg.xml`: The main Hibernate configuration file, including database connection settings and mappings.
- `log4j.properties` (optional): Configuration for logging, if required.

### 3. `src/test/java`
This folder contains test cases to verify the functionality of your Hibernate code.

### 4. `pom.xml`
For Maven-based projects, this file includes dependencies for Hibernate, MySQL (or another database), and any other required libraries.

### 5. `README.md`
This file provides an overview and instructions for using the repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management
- A database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

### Setting Up
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Configure the database connection in `hibernate.cfg.xml`:
   ```xml
   <property name="hibernate.connection.url">jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database</property>
   <property name="hibernate.connection.username">your_username</property>
   <property name="hibernate.connection.password">your_password</property>
   ```

3. Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

4. Run the main class to test table creation and data insertion.

## Features
- **Table Creation:** Practice creating tables in the database using Hibernate entity annotations.
- **Data Insertion:** Insert data into tables using Hibernate.
- **CRUD Operations:** Extend the repository to practice Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.

## Future Enhancements
- Add examples for advanced Hibernate features like caching, HQL (Hibernate Query Language), and criteria queries.
- Include exercises for handling relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
